Task for an introductory course to programming. The goal was to create an application in Winforms that took as input the price of a purchase in SEK (Swedish krona), as well as the sum actually paid, and then calculate the change in bills and coins.

In my case, I added the ability to choose different currencies and to add/remove currencies (hardcoded into a list in the Currencies.cs file).
